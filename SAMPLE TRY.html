            Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an 
            American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run
             business called Timely Publications which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the primary
              creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing 
              house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.
